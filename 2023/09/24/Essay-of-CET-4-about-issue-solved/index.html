<li>“Therefore, our reading ability need to improve.” At last, we have written the second point.</li>
<li>Now we start write the last point. “Last but not least, no one can deny that it is high time that <u>we can access more information in books.”</u></li>
<li>And next we can highlight this last point that only in this way, can we access more couldn’t get in class. </li>
